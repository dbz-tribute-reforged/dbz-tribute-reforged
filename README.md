# wc3-ts-template
 An easy to use template to get you started coding in TypeScript for Warcraft III maps.

Setup Guide: [Getting Started](https://cipherxof.github.io/w3ts/docs/getting-started).

## Features
* TypeScript API and wrappers for most handles (see [w3ts](https://github.com/cipherxof/w3ts))
* Work on your map in the World Editor while also coding in TypeScript.
* Evaluate node scripts at compile time and support for npm dependencies (see [war3-transformer](https://github.com/cipherxof/war3-transformer))
* Build w3x archives from your project's map folder.
* Automatically generate definitions for global variables generated by the editor such as regions, cameras, or preplaced units.
* Works on Windows and Mac OS out of the box and with a couple modifications it works on Linux as well.

# Requirements
* git [git-for-windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Visual studio code (preferably)

# Install
open git in desired folder and type command
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dbz-tribute-reforged/dbz-tribute-reforged.git
```

this will copy the folder structure to your local folder and allow you to work on the map

the map file is in maps/Tribute_Reforged.w3x it can be opened by World Editor, it is recommended when you save that map to save it to another location due to possibility of string file corruption (.wts), and then copy that file in while still having the old and new map file as backups.

[read this for config options](https://cipherxof.github.io/w3ts/docs/configuration)

to test if everything works correctly type the command into your terminal (git bash or other, can do from vscode terminal too)
```sh
npm run build
```
